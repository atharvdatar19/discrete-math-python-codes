# Number Theory – Python Programs (1 to 34)

## 📌 Project Title
discrete-math-python-codes

## 📘 Overview
This project contains 34 Python programs based on Number Theory and Mathematics.  
Each file focuses on one specific concept such as divisors, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, sequences, primality tests, partition functions, and more.

All programs are written in simple, clean, and readable Python code suitable for academic assignments.

The repository follows the required submission structure including:
- Organized Python files
- README documentation
- Screenshots of outputs
- Optional screen recordings
- Project report

## 🚀 Steps to Install and Run

### **1. Clone the Repository**
https://github.com/atharvdatar19/discrete-math-python-codes.git

### **2. Move into the project folder**
cd descrete-math-python-codes

### **3. Run any program**
Each program is standalone.

Example:python 10_prime_factors.py

## 🧪 Instructions for Testing the Programs

To test any program:

1. Open a terminal inside the project folder  
2. Run the Python file  
3. Provide input when asked  
4. Verify the output manually  
5. Check screenshots inside `/screenshots` for reference  

Example test:

python 07_is_harshad.py
Enter number: 18
Output: True
This means 18 is a Harshad number.
